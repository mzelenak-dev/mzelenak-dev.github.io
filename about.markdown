Thank you for taking the time to review my information!

I attained my Bachelors of Science in Telecommunications from Ball State University in 2009 after transferring from another school. I worked a few jobs (Indianapolis Museum of Art, Clear Channel Communications) before my first engineering job as an HTML/CSS/Javascript support technician for a custom CMS provider, IMAVEX, out of Carmel, Indiana.

My next job was with MediaFuel in Fishers, Indiana creating custom Wordpress marketing domains and custom video productions for clients. I was also freelancing on the side with a number of clients, adding features to their products or helping to redesign their web user experiences. This led to my next position with ChaCha in Carmel, Indiana. They were an information search company who found themselves needing to reinvent their code base to acclimate with the growing social media trend. I worked with their owners, designers, and backend systems folks to build multiple apps, ranging from a social media prototype to re-inventing their data knowledge base into BuzzFeed-style content to sell more ads.

My next job was with SmarterHQ in Carmel, Indiana. They had built a cool predictive intelligence engine and wanted to create an intuitive and fast user experience for their web users and API users alike, which I helped build. We also created a similar web app that drove OnSite, their product that used the predictive user data to recreate clients' ecommcerce sites with user-specific data and content.

My first big break came when Salesforce hired me as a Senior Software Engineer. I spent 6.5 years at the Indianapolis Marketing Cloud and working with remote teams from all around the world on a wide variety of Single Page Web Applications that drove their B2B product lineup. I got to use a wide variety of languages, build out multiple eras of user experiences, and solved a giant volume of issues for Salesforce during this time.

I am now looking for my next opportunity and am excited to speak with you!
