Hi there, thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio site!

I am a talented and devoted software engineer with over 10 years of experience working for technology companies of all sizes, from small startups to mid size B2B services to world-wide enterprise SaaS organizations.

I have a passion for front end full stack development and have tackled projects in many languages, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, C#, PHP, Python (and even helped on some projects written in Java and Scala). I'm always interested in a new challenge and am looking to grow my experience in Swift and React Native to get more experience in mobile app development.

I have used a variety of frameworks to enable my web development experience, including React, Next.js, Flask, Node and many others. I'm a fast learner and pick up new concepts quickly. I'm always excited to learn new ways of creating exciting applications.

Thank you again for taking the time to visit my portfolio site. Reach out and let's talk sometime!
